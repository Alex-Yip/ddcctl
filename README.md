ddcctl: DDC monitor controls for the OSX command line
----
Adjust your external monitors' built-in controls from the OSX shell:  
* brightness  
* contrast  

And *possibly* (if your monitor firmware is well implemented):  
* input source  
* built-in speaker volume  
* on/off/standby 
* rgb colors
* reset 

This is ddcctl 0.1x ;) 
* rework of ddc read function to detect the correct TransactionType 
* this feature is adaptable - see Makefile for detailed information 
* optional blacklist support (read/write values to/from user-defaults) 
* new command-line keys for rgb colors 
* new command-line keys for reset brightness and contrast or colors 
* some more ... 


Install
----
```bash
make install
```

Usage
----
Run `ddcctl -h` for some options.  
[ddcctl.sh](/ddcctl.sh) is a script I use to control two PC monitors plugged into my Mac Mini.  
You can point Alfred, ControlPlane, or Karabiner at it to quickly switch presets.  

Known Bugs / Caveats
----
`ddcctl` gets a lot of bug reports for stuff that can't be remotely debugged or fixed.  

__YOUR PC MONITOR MAY SUCK AT DDC__  
The DDC standard is very loosely implemented by monitor manufacturers beyond sleeping the display.  
* This is because Windows doesn't use brightness sensors to dim screens like OSX does â€”via USB, not DDC!
* Adjusting brightness, contrast, and super-awesome-multimedia-frobber-mode may not be possible.   

__YOUR MONITOR MIGHT FREEZE__ when making settings, especially the non-brightness/contrast ones.   
* Power cycle the monitor.  
* You just have to trial-and-error what works for your hardware.  

VGA cables seem to wreak havoc with DDC comms.  
Use DVI/DisplayPort/Thunderbolt if you can.
