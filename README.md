DDC monitor controls for OSX command line
----
Adjust your external monitors' built-in controls from the OSX shell.  
You can adjust brightness, contrast, input source, speaker volumes (if built-in), and potentially other settings. 

based on [DDC Panel](http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/90077-controlling-your-monitor-osx-ddc-panel.html#post554171) and [DDC-CI-Tools-for-OS-X](ttp://github.com/jontaylor/DDC-CI-Tools-for-OS-X)  

Read the code if you want to implement more controls. Its ultimately making blocking I2C comms with the kernel, so be careful. 

Install
----
```bash
make
make install
```

Usage
----
Run `ddcctl -h` for some options.  
```ddcctl.sh``` is an included script I use to control two PC monitors hooked into a Mac Mini.  
You can point Alfred, ControlPlane, or Karabiner at it to quickly switch presets.  

Caveats
----
VGA cables seem to wreak havoc with DDC comms. Use DVI or DisplayPort if you can.  
I do not have Thunderbolt hardware to test with yet.
